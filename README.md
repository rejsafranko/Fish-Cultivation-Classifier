# Fish-Image-Classification

## Overview
This repository is part of a university seminar and focuses on classifying fish images using a private dataset from the Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries of Croatia. The project leverages advanced techniques, including data augmentation, a Vision Transformer (ViT), and a ResNet50 architecture to achieve accurate and robust classification results. Additionally, a Grad-CAM visualizer has been implemented for AI explainability, providing insights into the model's decision-making process.

## Features
Data Augmentation: Augmented the training dataset to enhance model generalization and improve performance.
Vision Transformer (ViT): Utilized a pre-trained Vision Transformer model for image classification, providing a novel approach compared to traditional convolutional neural networks.
ResNet50: Utilized a pre-trained ResNet50 model for comparison, showcasing the performance of different architectures on the given dataset.
Grad-CAM Visualizer: Integrated a Grad-CAM visualizer to interpret and visualize the model's attention, offering insights into the regions of the image influencing the classification decision.
