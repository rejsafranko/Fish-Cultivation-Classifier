[STILL IN DEVELOPMENT] ❗❗❗

## Project Overview
This repository supports an academic project which focuses on creating a fish cultivation classifier on a dataset owned by the Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries of Croatia. The project displays the use of computer vision techniques, including data augmentation, a Vision Transformer (ViT), and a ResNet50 architecture for achieving accurate and robust classification results. Additionally, a Grad-CAM visualizer has been implemented for AI explainability, providing insights into the model's decision-making process.

## Features
- **Data Augmentation**: Augmented the training dataset to enhance model generalization and improve performance.

- **Vision Transformer (ViT)**: Utilized a pre-trained Vision Transformer model for image classification, providing a novel approach compared to traditional convolutional neural networks.

- **ResNet50**: Utilized a pre-trained ResNet50 model for comparison, showcasing the performance of different architectures on the given dataset.

- **Grad-CAM Visualizer**: Integrated a Grad-CAM visualizer to interpret and visualize the model's attention, offering insights into the regions of the image influencing the classification decision.
